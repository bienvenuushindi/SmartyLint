
List of TODO's:-

1. Add following rules
   * Don't use TAB. Use 4 spaces.
   * Use unix line endings (\\n).
   * Use periods in Smarty array variables ({$user.id}). Don't use brackets ({$user['id']})

2. Improve Smarty Tokenizer code.


Rough plan for points 2:-

It should tokenize tags just the way like it tokenzis comments, html comment, spaces, new line chars.
It should tokenize smarty tags like {if}, {else}..etc
And gradually add more rules like empty if, empty else, empty foreach are not allowed.
