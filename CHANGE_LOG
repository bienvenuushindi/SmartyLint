3. You should write file doc comment at the top in Java Doc format which contains short file description and all the variables used.
4. File comment and content should have one blank line in between.
5. There should be no TODO's and FixMe's in the code.

8. Have max only 2 empty lines in the content (i.e. 3 new lines in a row).

"php smartyl -h" would show you all available options.
